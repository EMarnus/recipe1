                            <p><strong>Whether it’s with friends, coworkers, family members, or the community, a grand gathering of people who share a common thread of any type is almost assuredly guaranteed to be a good time!</strong> While it can take some time and careful planning and coordination, the end result is a group of people who become better acquaintances, better friends, and better people all around.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>One of the biggest reasons to host a gathering of any type is to visit with people you may not have seen in a long time or have lost touch with. In our busy day-to-day lives, it’s all too easy to let days, weeks, and months pass by without giving Grandma Jane a call or writing a letter to Uncle Doug. While letters and phone calls are better than nothing (and sometimes the best we can do with present situations), nothing beats having a get-together and actually seeing loved ones and being able to hug them.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>At any party or gathering, have you ever stopped for a moment to look around the banquet space and see how happy everyone is? Laughter, smiles, good conversation, and fun are the ties that bind human beings. People who partake in gatherings and social events with others are often found to be less likely to experience symptoms of depression – especially children. Being surrounded by others who we value often makes us happy, so few things are better for lifting spirits than a gathering of all those people. It strengthens bonds between us and allows for the chance to reconnect and forget their problems for a while, which can do so much good for a person’s spirit.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>There are few people who do not look forward to the food that is offered at parties and get-togethers; it’s often the centrepiece of any event, a great conversation topic, and something that everyone just totally enjoys (and needs)! Food doesn’t have to be the most expensive dishes you can think of, either – oftentimes, people prefer the simple stuff or the foods they’re used to having instead of expensive, exotic, unfamiliar dishes. Have everyone who comes to the gathering bring a dish, combine that with one or both of the recipes to the right and you will have a fantastic spread. These are both favorites of mine easy to make and even easier to eat while catching up.</p>
